# In-painting 
Python implementation of A. Criminisi object removal algorithm
It has two input parameters: the original image in RGB and the desired mask to be inpainted in color mode of Gray

* OpenCV
* Numpy
* NVIDIA CUDA 

# Sample input and output
![marked area to be removed](C:\Users\Meshkat\problem_2)
![marked area after inpainting](C:\Users\Meshkat\problem_2_out_5)
